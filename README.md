# Election_Analysis
 As part of this project, we analyzed the election audit of the Colorado Board of Elections.  To execute the scripts, we use Visual Studio Code and Python programming language. By running my script, I was able to determine that three hundred sixty-nine thousand seven hundred eleven votes were cast in the state of Colorado. Further, I found out that Diana DeGette won the election with 73.8% (272,892) after I run my script.
